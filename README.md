# javafinal
implementation of final method variable and class.

In Java, we have a final keyword which is used to restrict the modification of anything,
like if we have a variable, and we are declaring it with the keyword final we cannot modify the variable, or we cannot change the value of that variable.
If we're using the final keyword with a method we can not modify that method which means we cannot override that method.
If we are using final with a class we cannot modify that class means we are restricting the modification process of that class and that is we cannot inherit that class.
