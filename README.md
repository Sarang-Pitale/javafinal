# javafinal
implementation of final method variable and class.

In Java we have final keyword which is used to restrict the modification of anything,
like if we have a variable, and we are defining it with a keyword final we cannot modify the variable, or we cannot change the value of that variable.
If we're using final keyword with a method we can modify that method it means we cannot override that method .
If we are using final with a class we cannot modify that class means we are restricting the modification process of that class and that is we cannot inherit that class .
